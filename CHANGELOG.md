# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **RAK4631 Ethernet host transport** — KISS over TCP (port 7633) through the RAK13800 WisBlock module (WIZnet W5100S). The module is detected at runtime, so the regular RAK4631 image serves boards with and without it. Based on the work in #48.

### Changed

- **Provisioning wire format** — reworked the wire protocol for lower LoRa airtime and fewer round-trips. Breaking change from the previous format:
    - `GET_STATE` now returns `{Values, Drafts?, Hash}`; the `Draft` request flag folds drafts into the same response.
    - `GET_STATE` supports a `PriorHash` short-circuit: clients echo the previous response's `Hash` back, and the server responds `{Unchanged: true}` when state hasn't changed.
    - `SET_STATE` requests use a `{State: {...}, IncludeState?, ReqCompress?}` envelope. With `IncludeState: true`, the response includes `PostOpValues` / `PostOpDrafts` / `PostOpHash` — Save no longer needs a follow-up `GET_STATE`.
    - `COMMIT` requests use a `{NamespaceFilter?, IncludeState?, ReqCompress?}` map (was a bare `[ns_ids]` array). With `IncludeState: true`, the response carries post-commit `PostOpValues` and `PostOpHash` — Commit no longer needs a follow-up refresh.
    - `GET_CAPABILITIES` returns a namespace hierarchy map (`{NsId, NsName, NsParent, NsFieldCount, NsSchemaHash}`) instead of a bare id array; combined with `GET_SCHEMA`'s new `NamespaceFilter` support, this enables lazy per-namespace schema loading.
- **Web console** — refactored to use the new wire protocol. Save and Commit each collapse from two transactions to one; namespace-panel refreshes cache-hit via `PriorHash` when state hasn't changed since the last poll.
